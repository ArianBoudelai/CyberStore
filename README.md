Ok welcome to This Absolutely Useless Website!
This repo is a perfect tutorial on:
- how to look cool on GitHub,
- how to pretend you wrote everything,
- and how to desperately Ctrl+C & Ctrl+V your way to "expert" status.
If you copied this and pasted it in your portfolio:
congrats — you now own exactly what everyone else owns.
Do everyone a favor: change the colors at least.
CHEERS
